# AGNI_SPICE
** SPICE File Analysis and Simulation**

* In this bulletin, we will be discussing the recommended methods for analyzing SPICE files and the resources available to assist you in the process. Our study utilized the LTSPICE simulator (https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) for analyzing the SPICE file. However, any SPICE simulator of your choice can be used.

* To import the SPICE file into LTSPICE, please watch the following tutorial < >. The files consist of (.asc) extension, which is used for the circuit schematic simulation of AGNI for N=4. This simulation mimics the BLgroup size as 4, and the demonstration of this is described in the video < >.

* For ease of understanding, we have provided two separate video demonstrations of the SPICE simulation for transient analysis and the usage of the file. The first video < > shows the SPICE simulation for transient analysis, and the second video < > shows the usage of the file.

* The automation of the SPICE generation is done using the python package from http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/~tlehmann/ltspy3.py. To assist you in using this package, we have included a video tutorial on its usage in the following video < >.

**In conclusion, we hope that this bulletin and the accompanying resources will aid you in your SPICE file analysis and simulation process. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us at supreethms@uky.edu.**

# AGNI_SPICE
To analyse the SPICE file we recommend any SPICE simulator of your choice, but in our study we used LTSPICE https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html
SPICE files for the AGNI substrate is provided in this repository
The files consist of (.asc) which is used for the circuit schematic simulation circuit of AGNI for N=4, which mimics the BLgroup size as 4.

Also we have provided the video demonstration of the SPICE simulation for transient analysis and usage of the file in two seperate files for ease of understanding to the users.
To read this file you need to download LTSPICE software from the following authentic website url link
